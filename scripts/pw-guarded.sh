# Fail-closed Playwright runner — OSE-852 (MINE-0) Gate 0.
#
# A Playwright step that discovers zero tests is indistinguishable, from the
# outside, from a step whose tests all passed. That is the failure mode this
# guard exists to remove: discovery is counted BEFORE the run, a zero count is
# a hard error, and the count is published so a regression to zero is visible
# rather than inferred.
#
# The count is taken from `--list --reporter=json` rather than parsing human
# output, so it does not break when Playwright changes its summary formatting.
# A list that cannot be parsed is treated as failure, not as zero and not as
# success — unknown is never green.
#
# Usage:  PW_LABEL='Tier-1 page smoke' scripts/pw-guarded.sh <paths...>
#
# PROPAGATED FROM OSE (ourSharedEvents PR #423 / OSE-852, 2026-08-29).
# Kept byte-identical to the OSE original so the two stay diffable; fix it
# upstream and re-propagate rather than editing this copy in place.
#
# Why WKRP needs it: ci.yml passes a positional path to `playwright test`
# (`tests/e2e/smoke/tier1.spec.ts`), the exact shape of the OSE bug — Playwright
# filters positional args against the config's testDir, so a testDir change
# silently drops discovery to zero and the step still exits green. WKRP also hit
# this class at the spec level: an E2E spec that skipped on an empty catalog
# reported green while asserting nothing.
